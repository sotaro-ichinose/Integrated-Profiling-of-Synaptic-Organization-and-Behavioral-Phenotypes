## Contents

- `scripts_and_data/`:  
  Main folder containing all figure-specific analysis pipelines.  
  Each subfolder corresponds to a main figure from the manuscript.

  - `figure1/`, `figure2/`, ...:  
    Each folder includes both `.py` (analysis script) and `.csv` (processed data) files  
    necessary to reproduce the corresponding figure.

    - `supplement/` (within each figure folder, if applicable):  
      Contains scripts and data for figure supplements (e.g., Figure 1â€”figure supplement 1Dâ€“F).  
      These are organized similarly with `.py` and `.csv` files.

- `script_figure_mapping.csv`:  
  Index linking each figure and supplement to the specific input files, scripts, and outputs.

- `LICENSE.md`:  
  MIT license for code, and CC BY 4.0 license for data.

## How to Reproduce Figures

To reproduce a figure:

1. Navigate to `scripts_and_data/figureX/` (e.g., `figure3/`)
2. Run the corresponding `.py` script using Python 3.10
3. Input `.csv` files are included in the same directory
4. For supplemental figures, use scripts under `figureX/supplement/`

Each figure's pipeline is self-contained. See `script_figure_mapping.csv` for a global index.
